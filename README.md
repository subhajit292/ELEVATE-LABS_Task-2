Task 2: Data Visualization & Storytelling
For this task, I worked on visualizing sales and profitability data using the Superstore dataset in Power BI. The goal was not just to create charts, but to craft a clear, compelling story from the data — uncovering insights that can drive better business decisions.

What I Did:
Cleaned the dataset in Power Query by removing unnecessary columns like Row ID, Customer ID, and Postal Code to reduce clutter.

Built multiple interactive visuals to explore sales, profit, discounts, and trends across different regions, segments, and product categories.

Focused on creating dashboards that are not only visually clean but also easy to interpret.

Key Visuals Created:
Profit by Region and State
Identified which areas are contributing most to profit, and which are underperforming.

Sales and Profit by Sub-Category
Highlighted top-performing products and potential low-margin items.

Discount vs Profit (Scatter Plot)
Analyzed whether higher discounts are negatively impacting profit.

Sales Trend Over Time
Line chart showing monthly performance to spot any seasonal spikes or dips.

Segment and Ship Mode Analysis
Explored customer preferences and shipping method impact on sales.

Insights Uncovered:
Some high-selling states are not necessarily profitable due to heavy discounting.

Certain product sub-categories are driving most of the profit, while others result in losses.

Consumer segment makes up the majority of sales but doesn’t always bring in the highest profit.

Tools Used:
Power BI (for building dashboards)

Power Query (for data cleaning)

Superstore CSV (Kaggle dataset)
